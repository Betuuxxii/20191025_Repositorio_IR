# 20191025_Repositorio_IR #

## Homework 1.1 ## 

First of all, we create the account in GitHub in the link [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Then, we create a repository in the web. In my case, the repository is [**"20191025_Repositorio_IR"** ](https://github.com/esdalar/20191025_Repositorio_IR)

After that, we download it in our desktop and create a ".txt" file that we are ging to change and upload to github.

- For this, firstly we open "Git bash" and clone the repository:

```
$ cd 20191025_Repositorio_IR\
```

- We add the file that we want to commit:

```
$ git add "Apuntes_Integracion_Robotica"
```

- To be able to see the changes that we have done we write:

``` 
$git status
``` 
 
- If the changes are ok, we write some notes with the commit:

```
$ git commit -m "Some formats have been changed"
``` 

- Then we upload the files:

```
$ git push
```
